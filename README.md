This project is a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application developed using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface, and MySQL as the database management system. The application is designed to help keep track of missing persons. It maintains a record of essential details, including the individual's gender, height, the date they were reported missing, and a contact phone number for one of their relatives. This contact information can be used to reach out in case anyone has information about the missing person.
